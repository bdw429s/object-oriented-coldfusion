title: What is an Object?

<h1>A Simple Object</h1>

<p>
	In <a href="component-basics.html">component basics</a> we introduced a component called a 
	<b>ThresholdCounter.cfc</b>. 
	Lets revisit our Threshold Counter now and take a look at it from an object oriented perspective:
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent output="false">

    <cfset variables.threshold = 100>
    <cfset variables.currentTotal = 0>

    <cffunction name="addAmount" output="false" returntype="void">
        <cfargument name="amount" type="numeric" required="true">
        <cfset variables.currentTotal = variables.currentTotal + arguments.amount>
    </cffunction>

    <cffunction name="thresholdHasBeenReached" output="false" returntype="boolean">
        <cfset var thresholdReached = variables.currentTotal ge variables.threshold>
        <cfreturn thresholdReached>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	This component is used to create what we will call &quot;Threshold Counter&quot; objects, 
	whose jobs are to add up numbers and to know if a particular maximum amount (our threshold) has been reached.
</p>

<h2>Using our simple object</h2>

<p>
	Our object could be used like this:
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset counter = createObject("component","ThresholdCounter")>
<cfloop index="i" from="1" to="100">
    <cfset counter.addAmount(i)>
    <cfif counter.thresholdHasBeenReached()>
        <cfbreak>
    </cfif>
</cfloop>
<cfoutput>
    Threshold reached at value #i#.
</cfoutput>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	So we just add sequential numbers and stop when the threshold has been reached.
</p>

<p>
	This object demonstrate a couple of good OO concepts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It has variables and functions</li>
<li>It maintains state</li>
<li>The functions manipulate and use the internal private data</li>
<li>It performs the work we ask it to do</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Let's take a quick look at each of these points
</p>

<h3>Contains both variables and functions</h3>

<p>
	Typically objects will contain both variables AND functions packaged together.
</p>

<p>
	In our case we have two variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>threshold</li>
<li>currentTotal</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And we have two functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>addAmount</li>
<li>thresholdHasBeenReached</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintains state</h3>

<p>
	In the example code above we create the object just once, then call the 
	<b>addAmount()</b> and <b>thresholdHasBeenReached()</b> functions many times within the loop.
</p>

<p>
	For each call to addAmount() the <b>currentTotal</b> variable is incremented, 
	and the state of the object is changed.
</p>

<h3>Functions modify internal private data</h3>

<p>
	Both of our variables are prefixed with &quot;variables&quot; 
	(also known as &quot;placed in the <i>variables</i> scope&quot;). 
	This means that they are &quot;private&quot; to the component and only 
	functions inside the component can change them. For example, this code works fine:
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset counter = createObject("component","ThresholdCounter")>
<cfset counter.addAmount(20)>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	But this code, will result in an error:
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset counter = createObject("component","ThresholdCounter")>
<cfset counter.currentTotal = counter.currentTotal + 1>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	Our variable <b>currentTotal</b> is private and cannot be modified from outside the object.
</p>

<p>
	The other point to note is that our <b>threshold</b> variable is also private to the object 
	and the calling code has no knowledge of what that threshold value actually is. 
	So this information is hidden privately inside our object.
</p>

<h3>Performs work</h3>

<p>
	We have an object called a Threshold Counter. You can imagine that this object is a 
	new friend of yours who is helping you to add up numbers and to let you know if a 
	threshold has been reached.
</p>

<p>
	You say to your new friend, &quot;Add this number to your current count&quot; 
	and your friend does that job. You then ask, &quot;Have we reached the threshold?&quot; 
	Your friend responds with a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
</p>

<p>
	So your friend, your object, is doing the work of adding up and checking if a threshold 
	has been reached. You are not at all concerned with <i>how</i> your friend is keeping track of those numbers, 
	you just trust that they are doing the job you asked them to do.
</p>

<h2>Improving Our Object with an Initialiser</h2>

<p>
	Right now our object has a hard-coded value for the threshold level. 
	It would be nice if we could set this value when the object is initially created. 
	This change would allow us to create ThresholdCounters that have different thresholds.
</p>

<p>
	In the <a href="the-init-function.html">next section</a> we will discuss the <b>init()</b> 
	function which allows us to prepare our objects before we start using them.
</p>
