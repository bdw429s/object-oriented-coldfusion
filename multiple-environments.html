title: Managing Multiple Environment Configurations

<h1>Managing Multiple Environment Configurations</h1>

<p>
	When developing an application you will most likely have a number of environments 
	that your code will need to run in. For example, you may have a &quot;development&quot; environment, 
	a &quot;staging&quot; (or &quot;testing&quot;) environment and a live &quot;production&quot; environment. 
	If each member of your team is developing an application on their own machine then they may each 
	have their own specific environment requirements.
</p>

<p>
	Let's take a look and how different environments may be handled using an object oriented approach.
</p>

<h2>Environment properties</h2>

<p>
	Your application will have a standard set of environment &quot;properties&quot; 
	that differ within each environment. This may include datasource details, file paths and domain names. 
	You may also have a set of configuration properties that should be the same across all of your environments, 
	such as a company name or application constants.
</p>

<p>
	Let's assume that for each of your environments you need the following variable properties defined:
</p>

<ul>
<li>assetsPath</li>
<li>documentsPath</li>
<li>datasourceName</li>
<li>datasourceUser</li>
<li>datasourcePass</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And assume that the common properties for your environments are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>assetsUrl</li>
<li>documentsUrl</li>
<li>companyName</li>
</ul>

<p>
	There are many ways of storing this information, 
	but a common technique is to use an XML file. 
	Let's create a single XML file that contains details for <i>all</i> of the environments. 
</p>






{% highlight xml %}
<environments>

    <common>
        <assetsUrl>/assets</assetsUrl>
        <documentsUrl>/documents</documentsUrl>
        <companyName>Your Company</companyName>
    </common>

    <development>
        <assetsPath>c:/data/workspace/yourcompany/assets</assetsPath>
        <documentsPath>c:/data/workspace/yourcompany/files/documents</documentsPath>
        <datasourceName>yourcompany_dev</datasourceName>
        <datasourceUser>yourcompany</datasourceUser>
        <datasourcePass>abc123</datasourcePass>
    </development>

    <staging>
        <assetsPath>/staging/sites/yourcompany/assets</assetsPath>
        <documentsPath>/staging/sites/yourcompany/files/documents</documentsPath>
        <datasourceName>yourcompany_staging</datasourceName>
        <datasourceUser>yourcompany</datasourceUser>
        <datasourcePass>def456</datasourcePass>
    </staging>

    <production>
        <assetsPath>/production/sites/yourcompany/assets</assetsPath>
        <documentsPath>/production/sites/yourcompany/files/documents</documentsPath>
        <datasourceName>yourcompany_live</datasourceName>
        <datasourceUser>yourcompany</datasourceUser>
        <datasourcePass>ghi789</datasourcePass>
    </production>

</environments>
{% endhighlight %}









<p>
	You'll notice a section called &quot;common&quot; which will be used to hold 
	properties that are common to all environments. Each other environment gets its own 
	section in the file. You can add as many different environments as you need.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different ways of designing your XML (see references below), 
	but this approach nicely lends itself to direct conversion to CFML struct, 
	and can also supports nested values if required.
</p>

<h2>What objects do we need?</h2>

<p>
	When planning objects you are looking to identify any things that may need 
	to change over time and separate those things.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, the storage format of our environment data may change. 
	The format of the XML file may change, or we may choose to move the environment 
	information from an XML file into a component. 
</p>

<p>
	We will also need a way of identifying the environment we are currently running in. 
	For example, initially we may start with using domain names to identify our environment. 
	But if our application moves to a more complex environment with multiple ColdFusion 
	instances in a cluster then we may need to use another technique such as storing the 
	current environment name in a file on each server instance.
</p>

<p>
	So at the very least we will create two objects:
</p>

<p>
	<b>EnvronmentIdentifier</b>, which tells us the environment we are running in. 
	It will hide (encapsulate) the environment identification technique, whether it be by 
	domain name, file or other means.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Environment</b>, which provides us with the properties relevant for the current environment. 
	It will hide (encapsulate) how the environment properties are stored. 
</p>

<h2>Designing an Environment object</h2>

<p>
	Let's start by creating an Environment object:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Environment UML diagram' src='assets/images/C4A03C83E326027D6654E518DEBCA87C.png'>
</p>

<p>
	Our environment object will know about all of the possible environments, 
	so the use() function will tell it which environment values it should use. 
	The property() function will just return the value of that property for the currently selected environment.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, we are using an XML file for all of the environment details, 
	so we will need to initialise our object with the file path of the environment XML file. 
	Let's take a look at how we may use our environment object:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Create the environment object ---> 
<cfset envPath = expandPath("/config/environments.xml.cfm")>
<cfset environment = createObject("component","com.util.Environment").init( envPath )>

<!--- Tell it to use the "development" environment --->
<cfset environment.use("development")>

<!--- Display one of the environment properties --->
<cfoutput>
    #environment.property("datasourceName")#
</cfoutput>
{% endhighlight %}





<h2>Implementing an Environment object</h2>

<p>
	Let's take a look at how we might implement our environment object.
</p>

<p>
	First, we need to read the XML file and convert the contained data 
	to a format that's easy to use. The format described above converts 
	nicely into a struct using an <a href="http://xml2struct.riaforge.org/">XML to Struct</a> utility.
</p>

<p>
	So to read and convert our XML file to a struct we have:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="environmentXMLFileToStruct" output="false" access="private">
    <cfargument name="environmentFilePath" required="true">
    <cfset var xmlString = 0>
    <cfset var xmlUtil = 0>
    <cffile action="read" file="#arguments.environmentFilePath#" variable="xmlString">
    <cfset xmlUtil = createObject("component","com.util.xml2struct")>
    <cfreturn xmlUtil.convertXmlToStruct(xmlString,structNew())>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	This returns a struct that has the identical structure to the XML file above:
</p>

<p>
	<img src="assets/images/environment-struct-dump.gif" alt="Environment Struct Dump">
</p>

<p>
	We will convert the XML file to a struct when we initialise our Environment.cfc object:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset variables.instance = {}>
<cfset variables.instance.environments = 0>

<cffunction name="init" output="false">
    <cfargument name="environmentFilePath" required="true">
    <cfset var environments = environmentXMLFileToStruct(arguments.environmentFilePath)>
    <cfset variables.instance.environments = environments>
    <cfreturn this>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Implementing the use() function is quite simple because the data 
	for each environment is stored in it's own &quot;sub&quot; struct.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset variables.instance.environment = 0>

<cffunction name="use" output="false">
    <cfargument name="environmentName" required="true">
    <cfset variables.instance.environment = variables.instance.environments[arguments.environmentName]>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Lastly, getting a property is also quite easy to retrieve from the currently selected environment:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="property" output="false">
    <cfargument name="name" required="true">
    <cfreturn variables.instance.environment[arguments.name]>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Lastly, we just need a little special handling of the &quot;common&quot; environment properties. 
	These properties need to be added to all of the other environments, 
	so we add a little extra code to the init() function:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction  name="init" output="false">
    <cfargument name="environmentFilePath" required="true">
    <cfset var envName = 0>
    <cfset var environments = environmentXMLFileToStruct(arguments.environmentFilePath)>

    <!--- Add the common properties to each of the other environments --->
    <cfif structKeyExists(environments,"common")>
        <cfloop item="envName" collection="#environments#">
            <cfif envName neq "common">
                <cfset structAppend(environments[envName],environments["common"],true)>
            </cfif>
        </cfloop>
    </cfif>
	
    <cfset variables.instance.environments = environments>
    <cfreturn this>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}




<p>
	This code has omitted a few details such as error handling, 
	but the complete code is available further below.
</p>


<h2>Identifying our current environment</h2>

<p>
	In each location where your code will execute there will need to be something 
	present than can be used to decide what environment you are in. 
	Some approaches that may be used include inspecting the domain name the code is running from, 
	or perhaps inspecting the contents of a file that is different in each location. 
</p>

<h3>Identifying the environment using a domain name</h3>

<p>
	Let's first consider that you are using the domain name to determine your environment. 
	Suppose you have three environments; development, staging and production that run on the following domains:
</p>

<ul>
<li>yourapp.localhost - development</li>
<li>staging.yourapp.com - staging</li>
<li>www.yourapp.com - production</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Let's create an object that identifies the environment you are running in. 
	This will be called an &quot;environment identifier&quot; and provides only 
	one function which returns a string representing the current environment.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Domain Environment Identifier UML diagram' src='assets/images/88A8475BFC66B48CC27628E8ACBC4117.png'>
</p>

<p>
	When our DomainEnvironmentIdentifier is created we need to pass in the current &quot;domain name&quot;. 
	This is obtained from the cgi.SERVER_NAME variable.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent name="DomainEnvironmentIdentifier" output="false">

    <cfset variables.domainName = "">

    <cfset variables.map = {}>
    <cfset variables.map["yourapp.localhost"] = "development">
    <cfset variables.map["staging.yourapp.com"] = "staging">
    <cfset variables.map["www.yourapp.com"] = "production">

    <!--- INITIALISATION --->

     <cffunction name="init" output="false">
        <cfargument name="domainName" required="true">
        <cfset variables.domainName = arguments.domainName>
        <cfreturn this>
    </cffunction>

    <!--- PUBLIC FUNCTIONS --->

    <cffunction name="currentEnvironment" output="false">
        <cfif not structKeyExists(variables.map,variables.domainName)>
            <cfthrow message="Cannot determine the environment for domain name '#variables.domainName#'">
        </cfif>
        <cfreturn variables.map[variables.domainName]>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	This is quite a simple component with the single task of determining the environment 
	based on the domain name. The object may be used as follows:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset environmentIdentifier = createObject("component","DomainEnvironmentIdentifier").init(cgi.SERVER_NAME)>
<cfset environment = environmentIdentifier.currentEnvironent()>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	You'll notice that the mappings for the domain names are stored within the object. 
	For a larger application this mapping information could perhaps be moved to a 
	separate file which is read in by the environment identifier. 
</p>



<h3>Identifying the environment from a file</h3>

<p>
	In more complicated environments, a domain name alone may not be enough to identify an environment. 
	For example, suppose you have two clustered servers running your live production code, 
	and some details are a little different on each server. 
	The domain to access them will be the same, but the environment details may be slightly different.
</p>

<p>
	In cases such as these we can place a file on each server 
	that contains the name of the current environment.
</p>

<p>
	CFML supports a file format called an &quot;ini&quot; file which is essentially made up 
	of &quot;section names&quot; in square brackets, followed by name=value pairs. 
	We can use this as a file format for our environment file:
</p>






{% highlight text %}
[environment]
environment=production
{% endhighlight %}






<p>
	So this shows a section called &quot;environment&quot; that contains an item named &quot;environment&quot; 
	with the value &quot;production&quot;. These types of files are called INI files and conventionally have a 
	.ini file extension.
</p>

<p>
	We can use the CFML function <b>getProfileString(filePath,section,item)</b> to read this value.
</p>

<p>
	Let's create a FileEnvironmentIdentifier object that uses this file to identify the current environment.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='File Environment Identifier UML Diagram' src='assets/images/FD18B02DA533CE5082827835544C6878.png'>
</p>

<p>
	When our FileEnvironmentIdentifier is created we need to pass in the path to the environment file.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent name="FileEnvironmentIdentifier" output="false">

    <!--- PRIVATE VARIABLES --->    

    <cfset variables.environment = "">

    <!--- INITIALISATION --->

     <cffunction name="init" output="false">
        <cfargument name="environmentFilePath" required="true">
        <cfset variables.environment = getProfileString(arguments.environmentFilePath, "environment", "environment")>
        <cfreturn this>
    </cffunction>
    
    <!--- PUBLIC VARIABLES --->

    <cffunction name="currentEnvironment" output="false">
        <cfreturn variables.environment>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Using our component is very similar to the DomainEnvironmentIdentifier:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset envPath = expandPath("/config/environment.ini.cfm")>
<cfset environmentIdentifier = createObject("component","FileEnvironmentIdentifier").init( envPath )>
<cfset environment = environmentIdentifier.currentEnvironent()>
{% endhighlight %}





<h2>Implementing an Environment object in your application</h2>

<p>
	Your environment settings are something that typically only need to be created once in an application, 
	so it's an ideal candidate for creating on application startup. 
	Let's write an example of how the environment may be created on application startup within an Application.cfc file. 
</p>

<p>
	Using domain name environment identifier:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="onApplicationStartup" output="false">
    <cfset var identifier = createObject("component","DomainEnvironmentIdentifier").init( cgi.SERVER_NAME )>
    <cfset var environment = createObject("component","").init( expandPath("/config/environment.xml.cfm") )>
    <cfset environment.use( identifier.currentEnvironment() )>
    <cfset application.environment = environment>
</cffunction> 
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Using file environment identifier:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="onApplicationStartup" output="false">
    <cfset var envPath = expandPath("/config/environment.ini.cfm")>
    <cfset var identifier = createObject("component","FileEnvironmentIdentifier").init( envPath )>
    <cfset var environment = createObject("component","Environment").init( expandPath("/config/environment.xml.cfm") )>
    <cfset environment.use( identifier.currentEnvironment() )>
    <cfset application.environment = environment>
</cffunction> 
{% endhighlight %}





<h2>Separation of environment properties from environment identification</h2>

<p>
	In this design of environment objects we have separated out the environment properties 
	from the environment identification. This means that either one is able to freely change 
	with little to no impact on the other.
</p>

<p>
	Further to this, the environment properties and environment identification code only exists 
	in one place making this part of the application easy to change.
</p>


<h2>Securing your configuration files</h2>

<p>
	In the examples above we made use of two configuration files:
</p>

<ul>
<li>environments.xml.cfm</li>
<li>environments.ini.cfm</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You'll notice that these files both have a .cfm file extension. 
	This is used to help ensure that the files may not be downloaded. 
	This type of file security implemented as follows:
</p>

<p>
	1. Place the configuration files into a subdirectory, such as /config.
</p>

<p>
	2. Create an Application.cfc in the same directory that simply contains a &lt;cfabort&gt; tag.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent>
    <cfabort>
</cfcomponent>  
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Any request to a .cfm file within this folder will immediately abort and prevent the file from being downloaded.
</p>




<h2>Environment object code</h2>

<p>
	Complete code for <b>Environment.cfc</b> component.
</p>

<p>
	This is a full version of the component that contains a few additional features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allows you to specify the initial environment value when the object is created. </li>
	<li>Extra function <b>name()</b> that returns the name of the currently active environment.</li>
	<li>
		Extra function <b>properties()</b> that returns a complete struct of all current properties. 
		It's worth noting that this should only be used for debugging and is not recommended for passing into functions directly.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integrating an Environment object with ColdSpring (Advanced)</h2>

<p>
	If you are making use of ColdSpring to manage your objects then 
	it is useful to have your environment object available as a ColdSpring bean.
</p>

<p>
	ColdSpring allows &quot;parameters&quot; to be provided when its &quot;bean&quot; 
	XML file is loaded. This allows us to provide it with:
</p>

<ol>
<li>the environment configuration file path, and</li>
<li>the current environment, which is found via our Environment Identifier object.</li>
</ol>






{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Create our  environment identifier, in this case a Domain based identifier --->
<cfset environmentIdentifier = createObject("component","DomainEnvironmentIdentifier").init(cgi.SERVER_NAME)>

<!--- Set the two properties that will be provided as parameters to ColdSpring ---> 
<cfset properties = {}>
<cfset properties.environmentFilePath = expandPath("/config/environments.xml.cfm")>
<cfset properties.environment = environmentIdentifier.currentEnvironment()>

<!--- Create the ColdSpring factory, providing our custom properties ---> 
<cfset beanFactory = createObject("component", "coldspring.beans.DefaultXmlBeanFactory").init(structNew(),properties)>
<cfset beanFactory.loadBeans(expandPath("/config/coldspring.xml.cfm"))>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Our Environment object would be defined within ColdSpring as follows. 
	Notice the use of the two parameter values ${environmentFilePath} and ${environment} 
	which are provided in the &quot;properties&quot; struct when the ColdSpring factory is initialised.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<bean id="environment" class="com.util.environment.Environment" singleton="true">
    <constructor-arg name="environmentFilePath">
        <value>${environmentFilePath}</value>
    </constructor-arg>
    <constructor-arg name="environment">
        <value>${environment}</value>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>
