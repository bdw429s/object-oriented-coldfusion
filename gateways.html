<h1>Introduction to Gateways and Database Access</h1>

<p>
	CFML provides a very simple syntax for accessing a database which in turn can easily 
	lead to database interaction in any file throughout your application. 
	Let's cover some guidelines on how you might structure your code using an object oriented approach.
</p>

<h2>Introducing a Gateway</h2>

<p>
	The term &quot;Gateway&quot; is the name of a well known <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html">design pattern</a>. 
	This pattern describes an object whose purpose is to encapsulates access to an external system or resource. 
	In our case the external resource is a relational database.
</p>

<p>
	There are a number of other design patterns that cover a variety of database access techniques, 
	but for simplicity and it's appropriateness within CFML we will simply use the term Gateway 
	to mean an object that communicates with a database. Our Gateways effectively represent a layer 
	above the database and are the only doorway to accessing its data.
</p>

<p>
	Let's take a look at a simple Gateway object:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='UserGateway UML diagram' src='assets/images/A38F7482A0D02CB45BEE93615A6A2AEA.png'>
</p>

<p>
	To use this Gateway you may write code such as:
</p>







{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Create your gateway --->
<cfset userGateway = ... code to create the gateway ...>

<!--- Create a user ... oops a typo there --->
<cfset userId = userGateway.createUser("Alduos","Huxley")>

<!--- Perform an update and fix the typo --->
<cfset userGateway.updateUser(userId,"Aldous","Huxley")>

<!--- Delete the user --->
<cfset userGateway.deleteUserById(userId)>

<!--- Find any others users with the name "Huxley" --->
<cfset users = userGateway.findUsersBySearchTerm("huxley")>
{% endhighlight %}





<h2>Gateways and Datasources</h2>

<p>
	Considering that Gateways are our doorway to a database, 
	they will need to know about the datasource defined within the ColdFusion Administrator.
</p>

<p>
	In many typical CFML applications the datasource details are stored in the 
	application scope and used wherever required:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfquery 
    name="userQuery" 
    datasource="#application.dsName#"
    username="#application.dsUser#"
    password="#application.dsPass#">
    ... SQL here ... 
</cfquery>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	However this technique of accessing the global application scope directly can lead to 
	<a href="procedural-vs-object-oriented-programming.html">code that is difficult to change</a>. 
	A better technique is to provide the Datasource details to the Gateway objects when they are created. 
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, let's create a Datasource object that will contain our datasource details:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Datasource UML diagram' src='assets/images/FB57B1EB3131F4D34707C1C0DBE7BF36.png'>
</p>

<p>
	The name(), username() and password() functions simply return the name, username and password of the datasource.
</p>

<p>
	Our Datasource component may be written as follows:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent output="false">

    <!--- PRIVATE VARIABLES --->

    <cfset variables.instance = {}>
    <cfset variables.instance.name = "">
    <cfset variables.instance.username = "">
    <cfset variables.instance.password = "">

    <!--- INITIALISATION --->

    <cffunction name="init" output="false">
        <cfargument name="name" required="true">
        <cfargument name="username" required="true">
        <cfargument name="password" required="true">
        <cfset variables.instance.name = arguments.name>
        <cfset variables.instance.username = arguments.username>
        <cfset variables.instance.password = arguments.password>
    </cffunction>

    <!--- PUBLIC FUNCTIONS --->

    <cffunction name="name" output="false">
        <cfreturn variables.instance.name>
    </cffunction>

    <cffunction name="username" output="false">
        <cfreturn variables.instance.username>
    </cffunction>

    <cffunction name="password" output="false">
        <cfreturn variables.instance.password>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}






<p>
	Once we have created a Datasource object then we can provide this object to all of our Gateway objects. For example:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Create our datasource --->
<cfset datasource = createObject("component","com.util.Datasource").init("recipeshop","recipeshop_dbo","abc123")>

<!--- Create some databases and provide the datasource object --->
<cfset userGateway = createObject("component","com.user.UserGateway").init(datasource)> 
<cfset recipeGateway = createObject("component","com.recipe.RecipeGateway").init(datasource)> 
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	So here we first create a datasource object and provide the datasource details to its init() function. 
	Next we create the Gateway objects a provide this Datasource object to their init() functions.
</p>

<p>
	This technique of passing the datasource into the gateway is a form of 
	<a href="dependency-injection.html">dependency injection</a>.
</p>

<p>
	So what exactly is the responsibility of a Gateway object. Let's cover some guidelines for Gateway design.
</p>

<h2>Gateway design guidelines</h2>

<p>
	We can start with some general guidelines for developing Gateways in your application:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Gateways are the only objects in your application that may contain SQL code.</li>
<li>Gateways do not know about objects, they simply execute SQL and optionally return query recordsets.</li>
<li>You should create a separate gateway for each &quot;logical section&quot; of your application.</li>
<li>Gateways are &quot;singletons&quot; and can be created once on application startup.</li>
<li>Gateways do not perform transactions</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Let's cover each of these in turn:
</p>

<h3>Gateways are responsible for all SQL</h3>

<p>
	As a general rule, if you need to write some SQL then it should be in a Gateway. 
	This makes any SQL much easier to manage because it is all contained in a single object. 
	This also helps to minimise queries being duplicated throughout your code.
</p>

<h3>Gateways don't deal with objects</h3>

<p>
	Good object design tries to keep the purpose of objects very narrow; 
	they should not try to do a wide scope of things. In the case of Gateways, 
	they have the very specific role of performing queries, and that's all. 
	This means that objects are neither passed into or out of the Gateway functions.
</p>

<h3>Gateways represent logical function groupings</h3>

<p>
	When creating Gateways they should be designed and named based on their &quot;logical&quot; purpose. 
	For example, it is better to have a &quot;UserGateway&quot; and a &quot;ProductGateway&quot; rather 
	than an &quot;AdminGateway&quot; and &quot;PublicGateway&quot;. 
	This means that the UserGateway, for example, provides both admin and public functions grouped together.
</p>

<h3>Gateways are singletons</h3>

<p>
	A singleton is an object that only has one &quot;instance&quot; in an application. 
	It is created once on applcation startup and stored in the application scope. 
	Gateways are good candidates for singletons:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="onApplicationStartup" output="false">
    <cfset var datasource = createObject("component","com.util.Datasource").init("recipeshop","recipeshop_dbo","abc123")>
    <cfset var userGateway = createObject("component","com.user.UserGateway").init(datasource)> 
    <cfset application.userGateway = userGateway>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<h3>Gateways do not perform transactions</h3>

<p>
	The &lt;cftransaction&gt; tag should not be used within Gateways. 
	As Gateways are performing the individual queries, it is up to the calling code to manage any transactional requirements 
	surrounding multiple Gateway function calls.
</p>


<h2>Implementing a Gateway</h2>

<p>
	Let's implement the beginnings of a simple UserGateway object.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent output="false">

    <!--- PRIVATE VARIABLES --->

    <cfset variables.instance = {}>
    <cfset variables.instance.datasource = 0>

    <!--- INITIALISATION --->

   <cffunction name="init" output="false">
        <cfargument name="datasource" required="true">
        <cfset variables.instance.datasource = arguments.datasource>
    </cffunction>

    <!--- PUBLIC FUNCTIONS --->

    <cffunction name="findUserById" output="false">
        <cfargument name="userId" required="true">
        <cfset var userQuery = 0>
        <cfquery
            name="userQuery" 
            datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
            username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
            password="#variables.datasource.password()#">
            select
                userId,
                firstName,
                lastName,
            from
                user
            where
                userId = <cfqueryparam type="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="#val(arguments.userId)#">
        </cfquery>
        <cfreturn userQuery>
    </cffunction>

    <cffunction name="createUser" output="false">
        <cfargument name="firstName" required="true">
        <cfargument name="lastName" required="true">
        <cfset var userResult = 0>
        <cfquery
            result="userResult" 
            datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
            username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
            password="#variables.datasource.password()#">
            insert into user
            (
                firstName,
                lastName,
            )
            values
            (
                <cfqueryparam type="CF_SQL_VARCHAR" value="#arguments.firstName#">,
                <cfqueryparam type="CF_SQL_VARCHAR" value="#arguments.lastName#">
            )
        </cfquery>
        <cfreturn userResult.IDENTITYCOL> <!--- MSSQL auto generated Id value --->
    </cffunction>

    <cffunction name="deleteUserById" output="false">
        <cfargument name="userId" required="true">
        <cfquery
            datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
            username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
            password="#variables.datasource.password()#">
            delete from user
            where
                userId = <cfqueryparam type="CF_SQL_INTEGER" value="#val(arguments.userId)#">
        </cfquery>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	We might use this Gateway as follows:
</p>







{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Create our gateway --->
<cfset datasource = createObject("component","com.util.Datasource").init("recipeshop","recipeshop_dbo","abc123")>
<cfset userGateway = createObject("component","com.user.UserGateway").init(datasource)> 

<!--- Create a struct containing all of the user data --->
<cfset user = {}>
<cfset user.firstName = "Samwise">
<cfset user.lastName = "Gamgee">

<!--- Create the new user, passing the user struct as arguments --->
<cfset userId = userGateway.createUser(argumentCollection=user)>
{% endhighlight %}





<h2>Gateway function names</h2>

<p>
	It is a good idea to ensure that your function names are not too short. 
	For example, avoid names such as create() or delete(). 
	It is better to have more explicit names such as createUser() or deleteUserById(). 
	This will better serve future needs such as if you needed to add functions such as createGuestUser() or deleteUserByUsername(). 
</p>




<h2>Which Gateway should your code go in?</h2>

<p>
	There are times where is may not be clear which Gateway object your query needs to go in. 
	For example, suppose you have a system for managing user submitted recipes. 
	You may have a UserGateway for user related queries and a RecipeGateway for recipe related queries. 
	However, if you need to produce a listing that contained both Users and Recipes then where should your query go? 
	And perhaps the recipes also belong to Categories, which are managed via a Category gateway, also needed to be included in the listing.
</p>

<p>
	There are various options but if the <i>intent</i> of the query is well understood it helps us to 
	decide which gateway the query should go in. In this example the <i>intent</i> is about displaying recipes, 
	whether it be by user or category, so this query is most likely suited for the RecipeGateway. 
</p>

<p>
	If the <i>intent</i> genuinely belongs in more than one area, then create a new Gateway specifically 
	for that grouping; a UserRecipeGateway. If you need one query in this grouped gateway then it's 
	likely you will need more here.
</p>


<h2>Handling dates, times and special UI fields</h2>

<p>
	It is common for us to collect dates, times or other special kinds of user interface elements 
	in a form and pass these down for saving to a database. When we get to the Gateway level we 
	do not want to expose our gateway to any details about our form. The important goal here is 
	that if our form is changed then it must not have any impact on our Gateway.
</p>

<p>
	For example, suppose we collect a date in a form field in MM/DD/YYYY format. We must convert this 
	to a date/time object <i>before</i> it is passed into the Gateway. The Gateway then only needs to 
	deal with a date object, and does not perform any string parsing. If we then change the format of 
	the date field to accept &quot;DD/MM/YYYY&quot; on the form for users in a different region then 
	we will not have to change our Gateway.
</p>

<p>
	Another example is with forms that contain a dynamic number of fields. For example, you may have a 
	form that contains field names preference_1, preference_2, preference_3, and so on, where the number 
	of preferences is different depending on the user currently logged in. In this situation the preferences 
	should be converted to a list, a struct or an array before being provided to the Gateway. 
	If the form field names were changed for any reason then the Gateway could remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>
	So the important guide here is that the Gateway should never work with the URL or form scopes directly, 
	and in particular should never perform parsing of form field data. 
	This must be done prior to the Gateway functions being called.
</p>


<h2>Minimising duplication</h2>

<p>
	When performing select queries it is common that you will want to select the same (or a similar) 
	set of columns in many queries. For example, you may have functions such as
</p>

<ul>
<li>findUserByUsername(username)</li>
<li>findUserById(id)</li>
<li>findUsersBySearchTerm(term)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In these cases it may be convenient to create a new <i>private</i> function named 
	findUsersByFilter() that can handle all of these types of queries. 
	If possible this function should remain private to the Gateway and specific public functions are written that call it.
</p>

<p>
	For example:
</p>

        <cfquery
            name="usersQuery" 
            datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
            username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
            password="#variables.datasource.password()#">
            select
                userId,
                username,
                firstName,
                lastName,
            from
                user
            where
                1=1
                <cfif structKeyExists(arguments.filter,"userId")>

                            or
                            lastName like <cfqueryparam type="CF_SQL_VARCHAR" value="%#arguments.filter.searchterm#%">
                        )
                </cfif>
        </cfquery>
        <cfreturn usersQuery>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}






<p>
	This can be particularly useful if you have a common set of tables that need to be joined on most queries.
</p>

<p>
	However, be careful not to let your &quot;find by filter&quot; function become too complex or large, 
	otherwise it may become a one thousand line monster for you to maintain. 
	If it starts to become too complicated to understand then it is better to create new functions for 
	the complicated queries and for you to &quot;wear&quot; the cost of the duplicate code. 
	After all, at least the duplicate code will typically only exists in the same single component.  
</p>


<h2>Handling sort ordering</h2>

<p>
	It is common to need to execute queries that are identical except for the sort order. 
	In these cases an additional parameter can be passed into the Gateway to specify the sort order required.
</p>

<p>
	However, it is useful to minimise passing in &quot;SQL syntax&quot; 
	ordering criteria into your Gateways. For example, suppose we have the following query:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="findAllUsersAndRecipes" output="false">
    <cfargument name="orderBy" required="false" default="u.lastName">
    <cfset var usersRecipesQuery = 0>
    <cfquery
        name="usersRecipesQuery" 
        datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
        username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
        password="#variables.datasource.password()#">
        select
            u.userId,
            u.firstName,
            u.lastName,
            r.recipeId,
            r.recipeName
        from
            user u
            inner join recipe r on u.userId = r.userId
        order by
           #arguments.orderBy#
        </cfquery>
    <cfreturn usersRecipesQuery>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	When using this function we may write something like:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Find all users and recipes, ordered by recipe name, then user first name --->  
<cfset usersAndRecipes = recipeGateway.findAllUsersAndRecipes("r.recipeName,u.firstName")>
{% endhighlight %}






<p>
	The problem with here is that the code that uses the Gateway needs to know details 
	about the underlying query in order to provide the order by values. 
	If the &quot;aliases&quot; of the gateway query needed to change for any reason 
	then we would also need to change all of the calling code.
</p>


<p>
	An alternative approach is to pass in keywords that represent the sortable columns. 
	For example, it would be better to write this:
</p>







{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Find all users and recipes, ordered by recipe name, then user first name --->  
<cfset usersAndRecipes = recipeGateway.findAllUsersAndRecipes("recipeName,firstName")>
{% endhighlight %}




<p>
	And change our query order by statement slightly by creating a lookup 
	struct of &quot;sortable&quot; fields and the corresponding sort values.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="findAllUsersAndRecipes" output="false">
    <cfargument name="orderBy" required="false" default="lastName">
    <cfset var usersRecipesQuery = 0>
    <cfset var field = "">
    <cfset var orderBySQL = "">
    <cfset var orderByFields = {}>

    <!--- Create the order by lookup --->
    <cfset orderByFields["firstName"] = "u.firstName">
    <cfset orderByFields["lastName"] = "u.lastName">
    <cfset orderByFields["recipeName"] = "r.recipeName">

    <!--- Create the actual order by SQL statement --->
    <cfloop index="field" list="#arguments.orderBy#">
        <cfif structKeyExists(orderByFields,field)>
            <cfset orderBySQL = listAppend(orderBySQL,orderByFields[field])>
        </cfif>
    </cfloop>

    <cfquery
        name="usersRecipesQuery" 
        datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
        username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
        password="#variables.datasource.password()#">
        select
            u.userId,
            u.firstName,
            u.lastName,
            r.recipeId,
            r.recipeName
        from
            user u
            inner join recipe r on u.userId = r.userId

        <!--- Only sort if an orderBy list is provided --->
        <cfif len(orderBySQL) gt 0>
            order by
                #orderBySQL#
        </cfif>

    </cfquery>
    <cfreturn usersRecipesQuery>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	For simple Gateways this kind of additional work may not be required, 
	but if there are numerous calls to a Gateway with varied order by statements, 
	then this may be of benefit.
</p>



<h2>Accessing multiple datasources</h2>

<p>
	If you have an application that needs to access multiple databases, 
	then this is quite easily managed by creating multiple datasource objects; one for each database.
</p>

<p>
	If different Gateways need different datasources, then only the relevant Datasource object 
	is provided to the Gateway's init() function.
</p>

<p>
	If a single Gateway needs to access multiple datasources, then multiple Datasources objects 
	are provided to the Gateways init() function.
</p>

<p>
	For example:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<!--- Create two datasources --->
<cfset userDatasource = createObject("component","com.util.Datasource").init("recipeshop_users","recipeshop_users_dbo","xyz987")>
<cfset recipeDatasource = createObject("component","com.util.Datasource").init("recipeshop_recipes","recipeshop_recipes_dbo","abc123")>

<!--- Create some Gateways that use different datasources --->
<cfset userGateway = createObject("component","com.user.UserGateway").init(userDatasource)>

<h2>Dynamically generated SQL</h2>

<p>
	If you have a situation where you need to dynamically generate your SQL statements. 
	There may be complexities in your application that require complex select lists and 
	differing table joins depending on certain criteria. This kind of work can significantly 
	complicate your SQL statements and make your Gateway objects complicated to maintain. 
	In cases such as these it may be better to separate out the SQL construction into a separate 
	object to leave the actual execution of the SQL for the Gateway.
</p>

<p>
	For example, suppose you have a very complicated reporting query that provides significantly 
	different data depending on the currently logged in user. You can create new component 
	<i>ReportingQueryBuilder.cfc</i> to generate this SQL for you.
</p>

<p>
	The calling code may be written something like:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset currentUser = ... get access to the currently logged in user ...>
<cfset reportQuery = reportGateway.generateUserReportData( currentUser.userId() )>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	Then in your Gateway function you silently generates the required SQL:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="generateUserReportData" output="false">
    <cfargument name="userId" required="false" default="lastName">
    <cfset var reportQuery = 0>
    <cfset var builder = 0>

    <!--- Create our SQL Builder object --->
    <cfset builder = createObject("component","com.report.ReportQueryBuilder").init(arguments.userId)>

    <cfquery
        name="reportQuery" 
        datasource="#variables.datasource.name()#"
        username="#variables.datasource.username()#"
        password="#variables.datasource.password()#">

        <!--- Extract the SQL from our builder object --->
        #preserveSingleQuotes( builder.sql() )#

    </cfquery>
    <cfreturn reportQuery>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}





<p>
	The ReportQueryBuilder performs whatever complicated logic is required to construct the SQL 
	and then simply passes the SQL back via its sql() function to be executed by the Gateway.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that with dynamic SQL such as this we are unable to use &lt;cfqueryparam&gt; 
	so data type checking of any user input would be required.
</p>
