title: Controlling Access to Variables and Functions

<h1>Controlling access to variables and functions</h1>

<p>
	When you are developing your components you will need to think about 
	what data (i.e., variables) you want to &quot;hide&quot; inside your objects, 
	and what functions you want to make available for other objects to use.
</p>

<p>
	Generally your objects should be very protective of the data they contain and, 
	if necessary, provide safe ways for accessing and modifying that data. 
	Data that is protected and hidden in this way is your &quot;private&quot; data. 
	Data and functions that are made available for other objects to use are considered &quot;public&quot;.
</p>

<h2>Controlling access to your data</h2>

<p>
	Inside a component, CFML provides two &quot;scopes&quot; for storing your object variables; 
	the &quot;this&quot; scope and the &quot;variables&quot; scope. 
	The &quot;this&quot; scope is used to declare public variables, 
	and the &quot;variables&quot; scope is used to declare private variables.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose we create a Superhero.cfc
</p>


{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent>

    <!--- This is a public variable that can be accessed and changed directly --->
    <cfset this.name = "Batman">

    <!--- This is a private variable that cannot be accessed directly --->
    <cfset variables.dateOfBirth = createDate(1939,5,1)>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	If we were to create a new Superhero object then we can access and change 
	the &quot;name&quot; attribute directly, but the &quot;dateOfBirth&quot; attribute 
	is protected and cannot be accessed outside the object. For example:
</p>


{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset batman = createObject("component","Superhero")>

<!--- This works --->
<cfoutput>#batman.name#</cfoutput>

<!--- This changes the objects name attribute --->
<cfset batman.name = "Dark Knight">

<!--- This causes an error because "dateOfBirth" is a private variable. --->
<cfoutput>#batman.dateOfBirth#</cfoutput>

<!--- And this would also cause an error --->
<cfset batman.dateOfBirth = now()>
{% endhighlight %}



<h2>Controlling access to functions</h2>

<p>
	Functions have an &quot;access&quot; attribute which allows you to assign different levels of access. 
	The two most common access types are &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot;:
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>public</td>
		<td>The typical access level that allows the function to be called from outside the object.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>private</td>
		<td>Hides a function inside an object so that it may only be called by other functions inside the object. You cannot call private functions from outside the object.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
	There are two other access types &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;package&quot; 
	that we will only briefly introduce here.
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>remote</td>
		<td>This is similar to &quot;public&quot; in that it makes a function available to be called from outside the object, but also allows the function to be called via a web service or a URL.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>protected</td>
		<td>Functions with &quot;package&quot; access are not very common. A package access function is one that may be called from any other object within the same folder as the component that declares the function.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
	The &quot;access&quot; attribute is optional and if not specified, 
	the function will default to &quot;public&quot; access.
</p>

<p>
	Let's consider an example of public and private functions on our Superhero.cfc component:
</p>


{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent>

    <!--- Private variables --->
    <cfset variables.name = "Batman">
    <cfset variables.dateOfBirth = createDate(1939,5,1)>

    <!--- Public function --->
    <cffunction name="getName" output="false" access="public">
        <cfreturn variables.name>
    </cffunction>

    <!--- Private function to calculate age --->
    <cffunction name="calculateAge" output="false" access="private">
        <cfset var age = dateDiff("yyyy",variables.dateOfBirth,now())>
        <cfreturn age>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}



<p>
	Now, using our Superhero object:
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset batman = createObject("component","Superhero")>

<!--- This works --->
<cfset name = batman.getName()>

<!--- This causes an error because calculateAge() is a private function --->
<cfset age = batman.calculateAge()>
{% endhighlight %}



<h2>Getters and Setters</h2>

<p>
	When you have private data that cannot be accessed directly 
	you may need to provide ways to access and modify that data. 
	The simplest way to achieve this is through the use of &quot;getter&quot; and &quot;setter&quot; 
	functions, which are sometimes called &quot;accessors&quot; and &quot;mutators&quot;.
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent>

    <!--- Private variables --->

    <cfset variables.name = "Batman">

    <!--- A "getter" function --->

    <cffunction name="getName" output="false">
        <cfreturn variables.name>
    </cffunction>

    <!--- A "setter" function --->

    <cffunction name="setName" output="false">
        <cfargument name="newName" required="true">
        <cfset variables.name = arguments.newName>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
	Again, using our Superhero object:
</p>



{% highlight cfm %}
<cfset batman = createObject("component","Superhero")>
<cfset oldName = batman.getName()>
<cfset batman.setName("Dark Knight")>
{% endhighlight %}



<h2>Why have private data?</h2>

<p>
	<img src="assets/images/keep-out-sign.gif" alt="Keep Out Sign">
</p>

<p>
	So why have private data at all, why don't we just make everything public?
</p>

<p>
	Let's consider an analogy where you are creating a proposal document to send 
	to a potential client but you need help from your co-workers to provide the 
	information you need. You decide to email it around the office asking each 
	co-worker in turn to add their part and make any corrections, then forward 
	it onto the next person. Once everyone has seen it the last person sends the 
	document back to you.
</p>

<p>
	Chances are the document you get back will be a bit of a mess. 
	There may be lots of jumbled ideas, inconsistent formatting and 
	perhaps the not even the information you were hoping for. 
	Perhaps some of the information you originally added in the document 
	has been replaced with what someone thought was better. 
	You have no idea who added what information and who deleted which parts.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, the document is your data. It is made public and anyone can access it. 
	You have no idea who will access it or in what order or if the changes are even valid.
</p>

<p>
	Let's consider an alternative scenario. This time you make a start on the document but rather 
	than asking your co-workers to add information to it, you ask them to provide you with the 
	information you need. As each person provides you with that information you determine which 
	parts are useful and you update the document yourself.
</p>

<p>
	After this round of changes the document now contains just the information you need and is now 
	both well organised and well formatted.
</p>

<p>
	In this scenario the document is your <i>private</i> data and <i>you</i> represent the object 
	that is permitted to change it. Your co-workers provided lots of information but you filtered 
	out what was not useful (i.e. you performed some validation) and carefully organised the 
	remaining useful information.
</p>

<p>
	Lastly, consider that you while you were working on the document you decided to change the format 
	from a general written document to a slide based presentation. In the first scenario, you would 
	need to advise all of your co-workers that you were using a different format now, 
	and they would all need to add their information to the new presentation document. 
	Some may not know how to modify a presentation document so would need to learn. 
	In the second scenario they would just continue to provide you with information in the same way, 
	but you would update your presentation document yourself. 
	Your co-workers would not need to change they way worked or learn any new skills.
</p>

<p>
	When you have public data any other object can modify that data so it becomes uncontrolled, 
	unpredictable and potentially incorrect. With private data you have functions that provide 
	the only means of changing that data. These functions can perform validation to ensure that 
	the data is reasonable, and if you decide to change the format of the private data then you 
	just need to change the functions that modify that data. Any other objects calling your object's 
	functions typically do not care that these changes have taken place.  
</p>

<p>
	This concept of hiding data is called &quot;encapsulation&quot; that we will discuss in more detail later.
</p>

<h2>A UML representation of public and private access</h2>

<p>
	UML diagrams support representing public and private component members.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Public and Private UML notation' src='assets/images/769FA16E892177A9D4AB5251A03A1DC4.png'>
</p>

<p>
	Public variables and public functions are prefixed with a &quot;+&quot;.
</p>

<p>
	Private variables and private functions are prefixed with a &quot;-&quot;
</p>

<h2>When to use the &quot;this&quot; scope?</h2>

<p>
	When declaring variables within components they may be placed in either the 
	public &quot;this&quot; scope or the private &quot;variables&quot; scope.
</p>

<p>
	As a general guideline, you should never use the &quot;this&quot; scope.
</p>


{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent output="false">

    <!--- Don't do this --->
    <cfset this.publicName = "">

    <!--- Do this instead --->
    <cfset variables.privateName = "">

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
	When you declare a variable in the &quot;this&quot; scope 
	it is made public and code outside the object can modify it. 
	This breaks the concept of having your object protect and manage the variables it contains.
</p>

<p>
	Some developers make an exception to this in order to  declare constants within an application:
</p>

{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent output="false">

    <cfset this.STATUS_ACTIVE = 1>
    <cfset this.STATUS_PENDING = 2>
    <cfset this.STATUS_ARCHIVED = 3>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}



<p>
	However, this requires the creation of one of these objects in each section of 
	code where the constants are required, even if the object itself is not required for any other purpose.
</p>

<h2>A note about performance</h2>

<p>
	There is a performance factor that must be considered when creating objects in CFML, 
	particuarly if you have an object with many attributes. 
	In Adobe ColdFusion each additional function you add to a component causes additional overhead 
	in creating that object. If you need to create many objects that have contain many functions 
	then the performance of your application will likely be impacted.
</p>

<p>
	There are some solutions to this which may include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide direct access to the data via the &quot;this&quot; scope.</li>
<li>Provide a function which returns all data as a single struct, rather than accessing each attribute individually.</li>
<li>Use generic set(name,value) and get(name) functions which are used to set and get all attribute values.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Another option is to change the design of your object so that the number of functions is reduced. 
	If you do have an object with many attributes with getters and setters, then there may be a better 
	design available that reduces the requirement of having all of them.
</p>
