<h1>Getting Started with Objects</h1>

<p>
	Object oriented development requires a new way of thinking about programming. 
	To get started there are some fundamental ideas that will help in designing and writing code in this way. 
	ColdFusion also provides an incredible amount of flexibility in how we write our components. 
	We can structure our components in a myriad of ways so we should also review good conventions in developing these.
</p>

<p>
	Many ColdFusion developers learning OO are coming from a strong structured/procedural background so it is worth first 
	taking a look at the <a href="procedural-vs-object-oriented.html">differences between procedural and object oriented programming</a>.
